Goals
- Learning how to work with a team, scrum specifically
- Learning to be really comfortable with git
- Designing an actual product and making it all fit together

Interests:
I hope to work mainly on the backend of the application,
dealing with databases and handling requests and responses
from the client application on the server side.

I have 2 learning goals I would like to achieve during this course:
1.	I would like to understand what it means to work on a project with a team and to have deadlines for certain aspects of the project. I’m guessing this is the way programmers in companies are supposed to work and I hope the course really teaches us how to manage doing this;
2.	I would also like to improve my programming skills throughout this course. Up until now I have programmed only data structures, algorithms and “applications” needed for the Computer Exam of OOP. But I don’t think that this is what real-life programs need to do. I guess they need to be easy to read and understand from the users, i.e. having a good GUI and to not crash if something is typed wrong from the user, i.e. having a well-thought structure and being tested multiple times.

I have worked in a team on multiple occasions – I was a part of a Mathematics team competitions a few years ago and I was also a part of a dancing group throughout my school life (where teamwork is essential in order for the dance to look nice). But I have never worked on a team project that takes more than a week and needs so much documentation (besides the coding). So I think this will be a bit of a challenge.
I was also programming a lot of algorithms since I was an Informatics competitor for about 5 years. But in these competitions time and space efficiency was pretty much everything we were asked to think about. While in this project I think the most important aspect of the program is to be easy to understand and to be easy to use. So, since I have never programmed a GUI and a working server before, I guess I’ll need to learn how to do that.

I am really motivated to research and work really hard in order for this project to be a success. After talking with my teammates I understood that they are really motivated as well, so I hope we can make the perfect application. We will be helping each other a lot and I am sure that after the end of quarter 3 all of us would have become better programmers and would know much more about programming in Java than before.
