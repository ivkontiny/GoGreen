Goals
- Learning how to work with a team, scrum specifically
- Learning to be really comfortable with git
- Designing an actual product and making it all fit together

Interests:
I hope to work mainly on the backend of the application,
dealing with databases and handling requests and responses
from the client application on the server side.

Strong points:
I’m good at working in groups
-	I had a class in high school where we had to do projects in groups, so I learned working together and doing your own tasks while communicating with group members.
-	In a team working together is very important so being good at that will help the team a lot.
Good at learning new stuff online
-	In my high school projects I had to learn a lot of new skills online like working with an Arduino or making an android app.
-	If someone in a team can easily learn new skills it is helpful for him and also for teammates because he can help them understand it.
Weaker points:
Sometimes I don’t speak up enough
-	Sometimes if I have an idea I won’t speak up so the idea doesn’t get heard even though it could be a good idea. Usually I just overthink stuff and decide not to say it which is not good.
-	If someone in a team has good ideas but doesn’t speak up, those ideas will go to waste.
I go to far in stuff that is probably not reachable and too difficult instead of choosing the easier route which sometimes is not worth it and wastes time.
-	In a project in high school I worked the first 4 of the 8 weeks on something very difficult which ended not working. That wasted a lot of time.
-	If I waste a lot of time on one thing which I don’t end up using I will be less valuable to my team.

GROW
GOAL
-	I want to learn to speak up and learn how to make important decisions in a team.
-	Working on big projects will include a lot of important decisions to be made and if I want my opinion to be heard I have to learn to speak up and contribute to the decision.
-	If by the end of the project I can look back at some of the big decisions and reflect if I contributed to them.
Reality
-	I am trying to speak more and just say what’s on my mind even though it may not always be right. Even it is not right, I get corrected and learn something.
Options
-	I can try to lead conversations and start the conversation for important decisions. That should make it easier to have a bigger voice in decisions.
Will
-	To achieve my goal I just have to do it. It might be hard in the beginning but I will get used to it and it will get easier.

I have 2 learning goals I would like to achieve during this course:
1.	I would like to understand what it means to work on a project with a team and to have deadlines for certain aspects of the project. I’m guessing this is the way programmers in companies are supposed to work and I hope the course really teaches us how to manage doing this;
2.	I would also like to improve my programming skills throughout this course. Up until now I have programmed only data structures, algorithms and “applications” needed for the Computer Exam of OOP. But I don’t think that this is what real-life programs need to do. I guess they need to be easy to read and understand from the users, i.e. having a good GUI and to not crash if something is typed wrong from the user, i.e. having a well-thought structure and being tested multiple times.

I have worked in a team on multiple occasions – I was a part of a Mathematics team competitions a few years ago and I was also a part of a dancing group throughout my school life (where teamwork is essential in order for the dance to look nice). But I have never worked on a team project that takes more than a week and needs so much documentation (besides the coding). So I think this will be a bit of a challenge.
I was also programming a lot of algorithms since I was an Informatics competitor for about 5 years. But in these competitions time and space efficiency was pretty much everything we were asked to think about. While in this project I think the most important aspect of the program is to be easy to understand and to be easy to use. So, since I have never programmed a GUI and a working server before, I guess I’ll need to learn how to do that.

I am really motivated to research and work really hard in order for this project to be a success. After talking with my teammates I understood that they are really motivated as well, so I hope we can make the perfect application. We will be helping each other a lot and I am sure that after the end of quarter 3 all of us would have become better programmers and would know much more about programming in Java than before.
